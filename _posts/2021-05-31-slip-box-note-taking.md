**Taking Notes**

1. **Fleeting notes** - jot down any ideas as they come.
2. **Literature notes** - take notes as you refer any material; link it to the **reference note**.
3. Daily review fleeting notes and literature notes to see how they relate. 
4. For each idea in fleeting notes, create a **permanent note** and put it in slip-box.
5. Create links between the notes - creating links is more important than collecting information.
6. Develop the project from bottom up.
7. Write based the information in the system.
8. Develop the above into an initial draft.
9. Edit the draft.
