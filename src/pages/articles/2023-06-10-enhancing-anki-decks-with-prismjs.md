If you're an Anki user looking to add an extra layer of interactivity to your flashcards, consider incorporating Prism.js syntax highlighting into your Anki deck. Prism.js is a lightweight and versatile JavaScript library that provides beautiful code highlighting for various programming languages. By integrating Prism.js, you can make your code snippets stand out and enhance the learning experience. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to add Prism.js to your Anki deck.

### 1. Download Prism.js

To get started, visit the [Prism.js website](https://prismjs.com/) and download the latest version of the library. Prism.js comes with both CSS and JavaScript files that you need to include in your Anki deck.

### 2. Locate Your Anki Deck Folder

Before adding Prism.js to your Anki deck, you'll need to locate the folder where your deck files are stored. The location varies depending on your operating system:

- **Windows**: Open the File Explorer, type `%APPDATA%\Anki2` in the address bar, and press Enter.
- **Mac**: Open Finder, click "Go" in the menu bar, select "Go to Folder," enter `~/Library/Application Support/Anki2`, and click "Go."
- **Linux**: Open your file manager, type `~/.local/share/Anki2` in the address bar, and press Enter.

Within the Anki2 folder, find the folder corresponding to your Anki profile (e.g., "User 1" if you have a single profile).

### 3. Add Prism.js to Your Anki Deck

Inside your Anki profile folder, locate the "collection.media" folder. This folder contains media files associated with your deck. Copy the Prism.js CSS and JavaScript files that you downloaded in Step 1 into the "collection.media" folder.

### 4. Modify Your Card Template

Next, you'll need to modify the card template to include the Prism.js files. Open Anki and navigate to the card template editor for the cards where you want to use Prism.js. In the `<head>` section of your template, add the following code:

```html
<link href="prism.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="prism.js"></script>
```

### 5. Apply Prism.js to Code Blocks

In your card content, wrap the code snippets you want to highlight with `<pre>` and `<code>` tags. Specify the programming language using the appropriate class from Prism.js. Here's an example:

```html
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Your JavaScript code here
</code></pre>
```

Replace "language-javascript" with the appropriate language class for your code.

### 6. Customize Prism.js Styles (Optional)

By default, Prism.js provides a basic set of styles for syntax highlighting. However, you can customize the appearance or choose from pre-defined themes by modifying the Prism.js CSS file or adding additional CSS files. Refer to the Prism.js documentation for more information on customizing the styles.

### 7. Save Your Template
