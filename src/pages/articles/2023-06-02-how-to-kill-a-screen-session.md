# How to Kill a Screen Session Using the "screen -X" Command

Screen sessions provide a convenient way to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single shell. However, terminating a screen session may not always be as straightforward as expected. In this article, we will focus on one particular solution that can help you effectively kill a screen session using the "screen -X" command. We will provide step-by-step instructions to ensure a successful termination. Let's get started!

**1. Identify the Session:**
Before proceeding, you need to identify the session you wish to terminate. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```shell
$ screen -ls
```

This command displays a list of active screen sessions along with their session IDs. Note down the session ID of the screen session you want to kill.

**2. Kill the session using the "screen -X" Command:**
The "screen -X" command allows you to send commands directly to a running screen session. In this case, we will use it to send the "quit" command to the desired session. Replace `<session-id>` in the following command with the actual session ID you noted down earlier:

```shell
$ screen -XS <session-id> quit
```
The "-X" option informs screen that a command is to be executed, while the "-S" option specifies the session ID to which the command should be sent. By executing the "quit" command, you are instructing the screen session to terminate gracefully.

Here's a breakdown of the command:
- `-X`: Specifies that a command should be executed.
- `-S <session-id>`: Specifies the session ID to which the command should be sent.
- `quit`: The command to terminate the screen session.

After executing the command, the screen session should be closed, and you will return to your previous shell session.

While terminating a screen session may sometimes present challenges, the "screen -X" command offers a reliable solution for killing a screen session. By following the step-by-step instructions provided in this article, you can successfully terminate the desired session. Remember to replace `<session-id>` in the command with the actual session ID you wish to terminate. With this knowledge, you can confidently manage your screen sessions and streamline your terminal workflow.
