When I started searching for the best charger for Samsung S22, I realised the market is full of 25W and 45W chargers claiming to be compatible. As a senior software engineer, I expected the process to be straightforward. I thought wattage ratings alone determined charging speed. But after testing different chargers and reading about USB Power Delivery and Programmable Power Supply, I discovered why some chargers fail to deliver Samsung's super fast charging.

I first tried a basic 25W charger that didn't support USB Power Delivery or PPS. These chargers are based on Samsung's older Adaptive Fast Charging protocol. The Galaxy S22 can charge with them, but only at around 15W-18W. There was no "super fast charging" text on the lock screen, and charging from 0 to 100% took about 90 minutes. For someone who needs quick top-ups between calls and code reviews, this felt painfully slow.

Then I considered a 25W USB PD charger without PPS. These chargers are better because they support fixed voltage levels like 5V, 9V, and 15V. The S22 can pull 9V at 2.77A for roughly 25W, but because there is no PPS, the phone has to regulate voltage internally. This leads to more heat, throttling, and a slightly reduced charging speed. Charging times improved a little but still fell short of the official Samsung charger.

Finally, I tested a charger with USB PD and PPS support. This was a game changer. PPS allows dynamic voltage and current negotiation in fine increments, like 3.3V-11V. The Galaxy S22 can request exactly what it needs to charge efficiently without creating unnecessary heat. With a PD+PPS charger, I could charge from 0-50% in about 25 minutes and reach 100% in 70 minutes. This is the experience Samsung markets as "super fast charging."

The story is similar for 45W chargers. While the Galaxy S22 supports only 25W charging, the S22+ and S22 Ultra benefit from Super Fast Charging 2.0 with 45W PD+PPS chargers. But even then, the difference between 25W and 45W on those devices is around 10-15 minutes for a full charge.

Many cheap chargers on Amazon and Flipkart advertise high wattage but don't include PPS. If the specifications don't explicitly mention PPS like "PPS: 3.3V-11V⎓3A," you won't get super fast charging. Instead, check for chargers that support USB PD 3.0 or higher with PPS for Samsung Galaxy phones.

Here is a decision table I created while comparing charger options for the Galaxy S22:

| Charger type                        | Works with S22? | Charging speed          | Super fast charging?      | Approx 0-100% time |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 25W charger (no PD or PPS)          | ✅ Yes          | 15W-18W                  | ❌ No                     | ~90 minutes         |
| 25W USB PD charger (no PPS)         | ✅ Yes          | 18W-22W                  | ❌ No                     | ~85 minutes         |
| 25W USB PD charger with PPS         | ✅ Yes          | Full 25W                 | ✅ Yes                    | ~70 minutes         |
| 45W USB PD charger (no PPS)         | ✅ Yes          | S22 limited to ~22W      | ❌ No                     | ~85 minutes         |
| 45W USB PD charger with PPS         | ✅ Yes          | S22 limited to 25W       | ✅ Yes (S22+)             | ~70 minutes         |

When buying a charger for the Samsung Galaxy S22, it is important to check for USB Power Delivery and PPS support. Wattage alone does not guarantee fast charging. Many high wattage chargers fail to deliver because they lack PPS. This is especially true for budget 25W and 45W chargers on the market.

In the end, I chose a 25W PD+PPS charger. It cost more than generic adapters but gave me the full super fast charging experience Samsung promises. For a phone that powers my entire day, from work calls to testing code on emulators, saving 20 minutes every charge felt worth it.
